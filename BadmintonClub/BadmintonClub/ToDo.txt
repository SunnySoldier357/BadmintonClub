Main things that I have to do:
 - New Season Functionality
 - Profile Page loading as well

Things that are necessary before release:
 - Loading notification for logging in and signing up
 - Check all icons
 - Set up an actual club PIN

                                                   POSSIBLE IMPOVEMENTS

UI
 - No connection (Offline Stack)
 - Colour coding for season table like green vs red for positive or negative point difference
 - Make date look nicer (no seconds)
 - Hide the add buttons when switching tabs (Season Page)
 - Margins make text nicer
 - Feedback Section
 - Settings Section 
 - Justified text
 - Optimisations for desktop vs. phone
 - Season Table can be ordered by the selected column

User Input
 - Matches can be added to a queue so that when the user has finished adding all the matches he wishes, they are uploaded together
 - Picker enhancements cannot pick the same person
 - BlogPost, when entering title automatically capitalises all words except prepositions, maybe even the same for the body of post.

Features
 - Edit BlogPosts

Data Processing
 - Ensure that loading is done before adding or refreshing again
 - Sync over WiFi as a setting
 - Loading is only done when stuff is not up to date and that the local stuff is only update not deleted and recreated
 - Make data loading happen faster
 - Code-First Migrations for backend
 - Client => Paging support with ListView integration for BlogPost and Signed-In User's Matches

User Authentication
 - Done through Microsoft, Google and Facebook

Organisation
 - For UWP, move pictures into Assets folder
