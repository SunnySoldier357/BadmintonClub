Main things that I have to do:
 - Make match fixtures for the season
 - Log in

Things that are necessary before release:
 - Hide the add buttons when switching tabs (Season Page)
 - Picker enhancements cannot pick the same person as well as text blocks cannot be blank

Things to optimise (Easiest to hardest):
 - Glossary for Season Table
 - Colours LimeGrenn vs DarkGreen for better viewing
 - Colour coding for season table like green vs red for positive or negative point difference
 - Margins make text nicer
 - Feedback Section
 - Settings Section 
 - Edit BlogPosts
 - Ensure that loading is done before adding or refreshing again
 - Loading is only done when stuff is not up to date and that the local stuff is only update not deleted and recreated
 - Make stuff happen faster
 - Optimisations for desktop vs. phone
 - Season Table can be ordered by the selected column
