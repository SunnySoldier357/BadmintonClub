Main things that I have to do:
 - Table for season stats
 - New Season Functionality

Things that are necessary before release:
 - Loading notification for logging in and signing up
 - Check all icons
 - Set up an actual club PIN

                                                   POSSIBLE IMPOVEMENTS

UI
 - No connection (Offline Stack)
 - Colour coding for season table like green vs red for positive or negative point difference
 - Make date look nicer (no seconds)
 - Hide the add buttons when switching tabs (Season Page)
 - Margins make text nicer
 - Feedback Section
 - Settings Section 
 - Justified text
 - Optimisations for desktop vs. phone
 - Season Table can be ordered by the selected column

User Input
 - Matches can be added to a queue so that when the user has finished adding all the matches he wishes, they are uploaded together
 - Picker enhancements cannot pick the same person
 - BlogPost, when entering title automaticcaly capitalises all words except prepositions, maybe even the same for the body of post.
