**Only Admins can add new Matches**

Adding a match affects both the player's and opponent's statistics.
Selecting the 'Season Match?' option ensures that this match also
counts as a season match, affecting the league table. Otherwise, the
match is considered a friendly and only affects overall statistics in
the profile page.

Selecting the 'New Season?' options completely resets the league table.
