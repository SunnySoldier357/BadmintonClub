Main things that I have to do:
 - Admin editing user names
 - Table for season stats
 - Start New Season Functionalty
 - Error Messages for adding seasonData (same person or score is not a number)

Things that are necessary before release:
 - Hide the add buttons when switching tabs (Season Page)
 - Picker enhancements cannot pick the same person as well as text blocks cannot be blank (Adding stuff)
 - No connection (Offline Stack)
 - Loading notification for logging in and signing up

                                                   POSSIBLE IMPOVEMENTS

UI
 - Colours LimeGreen vs DarkGreen for better viewing
 - Colour coding for season table like green vs red for positive or negative point difference
 - Make date look nicer (no seconds)
 - Margins make text nicer
 - Feedback Section
 - Settings Section 
 - Justified text
 - Optimisations for desktop vs. phone
 - Season Table can be ordered by the selected column

User Input
 - Matches can be added to a queue so that when the user has finished adding all the matches he wishes, they are uploaded together
